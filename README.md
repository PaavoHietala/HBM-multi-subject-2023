# MFInverse

Improving MEG retinotopical mapping accuracy with multi-subject joint analysis.

Adapted for particular multifocal retinotopic mapping dataset which has been preprocessed with MATLAB, but the functions can be modified for other data with relative ease.

## Usage

For "classic" MNE analysis, open `Code/pipeline_classic.py` and set desired settings in the file.
Run with `python Code/pipeline_classic.py`.

For reweighted Minimum Wasserstein Estimate (MWE0.5 or reMTW), open `Code/pipeline_reMTW.py` and set desired settings in the file. Run with `python Code/pipeline_classic.py`.
